Introduction
1.1	PROJECT OVERVIEW
The Attendance Management System is a software developed for daily student attendance in university. It facilitates to access the attendance information of a particular student in a particular class. The information is sorted by the operators, which will be provided by the teacher for a particular class. This system will also help in evaluating attendance eligibility criteria of a student. 

1.2 PROBLEM STATMENT
Attendance management has always been a challenge for colleges, with traditional methods like manual registers proving to be inefficient and time-consuming. An Attendance Management System can automate the process, making it easier and more accurate. The main aim of proposed system is to maintain attendance record of the students for a university. This will eliminate the need for manual registers and reduce the possibility of proxy attendance. 

ATTENDENCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (AMS) has four user module to run the system i.e. Admin, Staff, Student and Guardian. Initially the system will be blank, The Administrator has a rights to create standard and classroom for school and same time he has to add staff detail. Administrator generates unique username and password for all staff while adding staff detail. All staff maintain attendance of student, generate reports month wise, date wise. Guardian will be able to view their children’s attendance and Contact with relevant staff members.

1.2	OBJECTIVES
•	To make it easier and faster for administration to keep track of student’s attendance.
•	To maintain a secure and proper attendance report of students.
•	To build a connection between guardians and teachers.

Vision and Business Case
An attendance management system (AMS) is a software solution that educational institutes to efficiently track and manage student attendance, absenteeism, and leave requests. The vision for an AMS is to provide a centralized system for managing student attendance data, reducing manual data entry, and providing real-time visibility into attendance trends and patterns.
The business case for an AMS includes several benefits for institutes, including:
•	Improved Efficiency: An AMS can significantly reduce the time and effort required to manage attendance data, freeing up administration personnel to focus on more strategic activities.
•	Increased Accuracy: An automated system can eliminate errors associated with manual data entry, ensuring that attendance data is accurate and up to date.
•	Enhanced Student/Guardian Engagement: By providing employees with self-service access to their attendance data and staying in touch with guardians of students, an AMS can increase transparency and trust between students, guardians and administration.
•	Cost Savings: An AMS can help organizations reduce the cost of manual attendance tracking, such as paper-based timesheets and manual data entry, as well as minimize the risk of costly compliance violations.
Use-Case Model
•	Student Attendance Tracking: This use case involves students using the system to mark their attendance, either through a web-based interface or a mobile application. The system records the attendance data and provides real-time reporting to faculty and administration.
•	Attendance Analytics: This use case involves faculty and administration using the system to analyze attendance data and identify trends, such as low attendance rates or frequent absences. The system may also provide insights into student engagement and academic performance.
•	Leave Management: This use case involves students using the system to request time off for reasons such as illness, family emergencies, or academic competitions. The system routes the requests to the appropriate authority for approval and records the time off in the attendance database.
•	Compliance Reporting: This use case involves the system generating reports that demonstrate compliance with regulations, such as the University Grants Commission (UGC) guidelines and accreditation requirements.
•	Notifications and Alerts: This use case involves the system sending notifications and alerts to students and faculty regarding attendance requirements, upcoming events, and important deadlines.
•	Security and Access Control: This use case involves the system providing secure access to attendance data, ensuring that only authorized personnel can view or modify the data.
Supplementary Specification
Here are some possible supplementary specifications for Attendance Management System:
•	User Roles: The system should provide different user roles with varying levels of access and permission. For example, students may only have permission to mark their attendance and view their records, Guardians would be able to look up to their children’s attendance report while faculty and administration may have permission to view and modify attendance records for all students.
•	Integration with Student Information System (SIS): The system should integrate with the university's SIS to access student information, such as course enrollment and class schedules, to ensure accurate tracking of attendance.
•	Attendance Policies: The system should allow the university to define and enforce attendance policies, such as minimum attendance requirements, late arrival policies, and penalties for non-compliance.
•	Attendance Reports: The system should provide a range of reports to help faculty and administration analyze attendance data and identify trends, such as daily/weekly/monthly attendance reports, absenteeism reports, and class-wise attendance reports.
•	Mobile Application: The system should have a mobile application that allows students to mark their attendance, view their records, and request time off from their mobile devices.
•	Web Based Interface: The system should have a website that allow students, guardian and staff to view attendance records, and perform other relevant actions.
•	Notifications and Alerts: The system should send notifications and alerts to students and faculty regarding attendance requirements, upcoming events, and important deadlines.
•	Data Security: The system should ensure that attendance data is secure, with access restricted to authorized personnel only. The system should also comply with data privacy laws and regulations.
•	Technical Requirements: The system should specify technical requirements such as hardware, software, and network infrastructure, necessary to run the system efficiently and effectively.
•	Support and Maintenance: The system should provide ongoing support and maintenance to ensure that the system is up-to-date, and any issues or bugs are addressed promptly.

•	SIS: Student Information System. 
Risk List & Risk Management Plan
Here are some possible risks that may be associated with Attendance Management System, along with a risk management plan to address each risk:

•	User Error: The risk that teachers may make mistakes when using the system, such as marking incorrect attendance or entering incorrect data. The risk management plan includes user training and education, user-friendly interfaces, and automated data validation to minimize this risk.

•	Developer’s Negligence:
When a team of developers work on a project, they may design different style or type of models for a single entity. This leads to confusion for both the user and developers. The risk management plan will keenly look into such matters and correct them right on spot to avoid any future errors or faults in the system.

•	Non-compliance: The risk that the system may not comply with legal or regulatory requirements, such as data privacy laws or accreditation requirements. The risk management plan includes regular compliance audits and reviews and updating the system to meet any new legal or regulatory requirements.

•	Poor User Adoption: The risk that students or faculty may not fully adopt the system, resulting in incomplete or inaccurate attendance data. The risk management plan may include user training and education, and ongoing communication and support to ensure that users understand the benefits of the system and how to use it effectively.
•	4. Negligence: When data is stored in computers or laptops, it has become so natural that people lose the information when files are accidentally deleted or even it could fall into the wrong hands. Ensure a proper backup strategy to keep your data on important devices and run them smoothly without hassles.
Unsafe data: If adequate safety precautions are not taken when files and documents are shared in website, smartphones and tablets via internet networks, the information contained on them might gain access to the devices and get exposed to risks. We can make use of cloud deployments to manage the education system better and better.

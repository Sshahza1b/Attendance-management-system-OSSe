Introduction
The Attendance Management System is a software developed for daily student attendance in university. It facilitates to access the attendance information of a particular student in a particular class. The information is sorted by the operators, which will be provided by the teacher for a particular class. This system will also help in evaluating attendance eligibility criteria of a student. 

Attendance management has always been a challenge for colleges, with traditional methods like manual registers proving to be inefficient and time-consuming. An Attendance Management System can automate the process, making it easier and more accurate. The main aim of proposed system is to maintain attendance record of the students for a university. This will eliminate the need for manual registers and reduce the possibility of proxy attendance. 

OBJECTIVES

> To make it easier and faster for administration to keep track of student attendance.
> To maintain a secure and proper attendance report of students.
> To build a connection between guardians and teachers.

Vision and Business Case
An attendance management system (AMS) is a software solution that educational institutes to efficiently track and manage student attendance, absenteeism, and leave requests. The vision for an AMS is to provide a centralized system for managing student attendance data, reducing manual data entry, and providing real-time visibility into attendance trends and patterns.

The business case for an AMS includes several benefits for institutes, including:
Improved Efficiency.
Increased Accuracy.
Enhanced Student/Guardian Engagement. 
Cost Savings. 
Student Attendance Tracking. 
Attendance Analytics. 
Compliance Reporting. 
Notifications and Alerts. 
Security and Access Control.

•	Developer’s Negligence:
When a team of developers work on a project, they may design different style or type of models for a single entity. This leads to confusion for both the user and developers. The risk management plan will keenly look into such matters and correct them right on spot to avoid any future errors or faults in the system.

•	Non-compliance: The risk that the system may not comply with legal or regulatory requirements, such as data privacy laws or accreditation requirements. The risk management plan includes regular compliance audits and reviews and updating the system to meet any new legal or regulatory requirements.

•	Poor User Adoption: The risk that students or faculty may not fully adopt the system, resulting in incomplete or inaccurate attendance data. The risk management plan may include user training and education, and ongoing communication and support to ensure that users understand the benefits of the system and how to use it effectively.
•	4. Negligence: When data is stored in computers or laptops, it has become so natural that people lose the information when files are accidentally deleted or even it could fall into the wrong hands. Ensure a proper backup strategy to keep your data on important devices and run them smoothly without hassles.
Unsafe data: If adequate safety precautions are not taken when files and documents are shared in website, smartphones and tablets via internet networks, the information contained on them might gain access to the devices and get exposed to risks. We can make use of cloud deployments to manage the education system better and better.
